# Music Streaming Application

Developers: Bailey Inman, Jake Leonardo, Emerson Grier, Eli McKercher, Samarth Agrawal

We are currently developing a music-streaming application designed to appeal more to modern sensibilities, combining the core features of apps like Spotify with the shareability and aesthetics of apps like TikTok. We want users to feel more involved in the music creation process, whether it be by tweaking their favorite music via custom reverb + speed settings, or following along closely with their favorite artistsâ€™ recent developments through their feed. Ultimately, we are aiming for a tasteful Spotify-Bandcamp-Tiktok-Soundcloud hybrid that genuinely improves the experience of listening to music through unique and practical features.

Every two-week sprint, a different developer acts as team lead.

Path to Database: MusicStreamProject/BayWave/src/main/java/com/BayWave

PULLING DATABASE (BayWave): In my experience attempting to open the database IntelliJ project on a new computer for the first time, it doesn't
come with the password encoding library (io.liquer.pencil.password.encoder) due to libraries being included in gitignore. You can add this library like so: 
File > Project Structure > Modules > BayWave > Libraries > + (left side) > From Maven > Search for "io.liquer.pencil:pencil-password-encoder:2.0.2"
If it still doesn't work, you need to add it as a dependency:
File > Project Structure > Modules > BayWave > Dependencies > + (right side) > Library > io.liquer.pencil.password.encoder > Add Selected
