🎵 BayWave – Music Streaming App

Developers: Jake Leonardo, Bailey Inman, Emerson Grier, Eli McKercher, Samarth Agrawal

BayWave is a modern music-streaming application inspired by the core functionality of platforms like Spotify, with social features drawn from TikTok, Bandcamp, and SoundCloud. Our goal was to create an immersive and user-driven listening experience, where users can not only stream music but also:

  *Customize tracks with reverb and speed settings
  *Follow artists through a social feed
  *Create and manage custom playlists

While some advanced features were not fully implemented by the final presentation, all core functionalities were successfully developed.

🔧 My Role
This was a group project, but I was solely responsible for the Android application, which was fully developed by me. The Android client includes:

  *Music streaming via HTTPS
  *Custom playlist creation
  *Search functionality
  *A responsive, Jetpack-based user interface

Other parts of the system (such as the desktop client, database backend, server-side setup) were developed by teammates. They are included in this repository to reflect the full project scope.
